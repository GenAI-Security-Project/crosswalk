# DSGAI 2026 × OWASP AISVS 1.0

Mapping the [OWASP GenAI Data Security Risks & Mitigations
2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-genai-data-security-risks-mitigations-2026/) to the [OWASP Artificial
Intelligence Security Verification Standard
1.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-artificial-intelligence-security-verification-standard-aisvs-docs/), a technical
verification standard of 191 testable requirements across 12 chapters, used by engineers and auditors to verify that a
specific AI system implements a control rather than merely documents it.

---

## Why AISVS for this source list

Most frameworks already in this crosswalk answer the question of what an organisation should govern. AISVS answers a
different question: given a running AI system, what does an assessor check, and what does a pass look like. Every
requirement is written to be independently verifiable and starts with the words Verify that.

That makes this mapping the bridge between a risk in this source list and a concrete test an engineer can run. Where ISO
42001 or NIST AI RMF establish that a control must exist, AISVS states the condition that demonstrates it does. The two
are complements, not substitutes, and reading them together turns a control objective into an audit step.

AISVS also assigns each requirement a level from 1 to 3 reflecting implementation difficulty and how situational the
control is. That maps cleanly onto the tier model used throughout this crosswalk, so the tier column below carries real
information about sequencing rather than a subjective judgement.

### DSGAI01 - Sensitive Data Leakage

AISVS enforces authorization at the retrieval boundary rather than the response. C5.2.2 requires the end-user context at
each retrieval and assembly stage, C5.2.4 filters post-inference, and C5.2.7 propagates classification labels into
embeddings, caches and outputs so the aggregation effect stays governed.

#### AISVS mapping

| AISVS requirement | Control | How it applies |
|---|---|---|
| Verify that post-inference filtering mechanisms prevent responses from including data that the requester is not authorized to receive. | [5.2.4](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C05-Access-Control-and-Identity.md#c52-ai-resource-authorization--classification) | Level 2.

Retrieval pipelines enforce the end-user authorization context at each retrieval and assembly stage, the direct control for RAG over-retrieval |
| Verify that sensitive fields are detected before embedding and are masked, tokenized, or dropped. | [8.2.1](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C08-Memory-Embeddings-and-Vector-Database.md#c82-embedding-sanitization--validation) | Level 1. Sensitive fields detected before embedding and masked, tokenized or dropped |
| Verify that model-inferred sensitive attributes are not directly returned in outputs. | [11.2.1](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C11-Adversarial-Robustness.md#c112-membership-inference-and-model-inversion-mitigation) | Level 1. Model-inferred sensitive attributes not returned directly in outputs |
| Verify that training data includes only features, attributes, and fields required for the model's stated purpose. | [1.1.1](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C01-Training-Data-Integrity-and-Traceability.md#c11-training-data-origin--data-security) | Level 1. Training data limited to features required for the stated purpose, bounding memorisation exposure at source |
| Verify that output filters detect and block responses that disclose system prompt content or backend data. | [7.3.2](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C07-Model-Behavior.md#c73-output-safety) | Level 2. Output filters block responses disclosing system prompt content or backend data |
| Verify that data classification labels propagate to downstream resources (embeddings, prompt caches, model outputs). | [5.2.7](https://github.com/OWASP/AISVS/blob/main/1.0/en/0x10-C05-Access-Control-and-Identity.md#c52-ai-resource-authorization--classification) | Level 3. Classification labels propagate to embeddings, prompt caches and outputs, addressing the aggregation effect this risk names |

### DSGAI02 - Agent Identity and Credential Exposure

AISVS keeps credentials out of the model's reach entirely. C9.5.4 excludes secrets from the context window, system
prompts and tool call parameters, C10.2.3 stops MCP resource servers persisting tokens, and C10.2.7 blocks the token
pass-through that propagates one compromise across services.

### DSGAI03 - Shadow AI and Unsanctioned Data Flows

AISVS gives shadow AI a technical rather than policy answer. C10.1.2 allow-lists MCP servers, C6.1.2 restricts model and
dataset sources to approved ones, and C12.1.3 requires a structured inference log carrying the provider name so
unsanctioned egress is visible.

#### AISVS mapping

AISVS requires schema validation at each system boundary. C7.1.1 validates model output, C9.3.2 validates tool output,
C10.4.3 and C10.4.4 validate MCP parameters and messages, and C6.2.3 turns missing component metadata into a build
failure rather than a silent gap.

### DSGAI06 - Tool Plugin and Agent Data Exchange

AISVS treats the tool boundary as a trust boundary with a declared contract. C9.3.3 and C9.3.4 require manifests to
declare privileges and output validation and the runtime to enforce them, and C10.4.1 validates MCP responses against
declared schemas before they enter the model context.

### DSGAI07 - Data Governance and Lifecycle

AISVS supplies the technical substrate governance depends on. C1.1.2 inventories every training-data source with license
and use constraints, C12.5.1 records dataset lineage across transformations and merges, and C8.3 gives expiry and reset
on the retrieval layer so deletion obligations reach the RAG store.

### DSGAI08 - Non-Compliance and Regulatory Violations

AISVS is a technical standard and deliberately excludes governance, so it meets this risk only where a regulatory
obligation has a concrete technical control. C1.1.1 is data minimisation expressed as a verifiable requirement, and
C12.5.1 lineage is the evidence base for deletion and data-subject requests.

### DSGAI10 - Synthetic Data and Anonymization Pitfalls

AISVS tests anonymisation empirically rather than accepting it as done. C11.2.5 requires membership-inference

### DSGAI12 - Unsafe Natural Language Data Gateways

AISVS answers the NL-to-query bypass directly. C9.5.3 requires every access control decision to be made by application

the retrieval path rather than a service account.

### DSGAI13 - Vector Store Platform Security

AISVS covers the vector store as a first-class AI resource. C5.2.1 requires default-deny access control on vector

### DSGAI14 - Excessive Telemetry and Monitoring Leakage

AISVS bounds what telemetry carries rather than only requiring more of it. C12.1.3 fixes a structured schema for
inference logs, C12.1.2 and C12.1.4 scope safety-decision and RAG retrieval logging to defined purposes, and C9.5.4
keeps credentials out of the tool parameters that reach logs.

### DSGAI19 - Human-in-Loop and Labeler Overexposure

AISVS addresses annotator exposure in the labeling section. C1.2.3 requires sensitive information in labels to be
redacted, anonymized or encrypted before use in any labeling artifact, and C1.2.1 restricts who can create, modify or
approve annotations.

#### AISVS mapping

### DSGAI20 - Model Exfiltration and IP Replication

AISVS treats extraction as a detect-and-respond problem as well as a prevention one. C11.3 requires query-pattern
analysis feeding an extraction detector, response measures on detection, and watermarking or fingerprinting so
unauthorized copies remain identifiable.

### DSGAI21 - Disinformation via Data Poisoning

AISVS covers disinformation injection through the same controls as poisoning, plus provenance. C1.3 detects poisoned and
disallowed training content, C8.2.4 covers the RAG corpus path, and C7.4 attribution lets a reader trace a claim back to
its source document.
