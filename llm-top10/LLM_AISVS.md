# LLM Top 10 2026 × OWASP AISVS 1.0

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/) to the [OWASP Artificial
Intelligence Security Verification Standard
1.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-artificial-intelligence-security-verification-standard-aisvs-docs/), a technical
verification standard of 191 testable requirements across 12 chapters, used by engineers and auditors to verify that a
specific AI system implements a control rather than merely documents it.

---

## Why AISVS for this source list

Most frameworks already in this crosswalk answer the question of what an organisation should govern. AISVS answers a
different question: given a running AI system, what does an assessor check, and what does a pass look like. Every
requirement is written to be independently verifiable and starts with the words Verify that.

That makes this mapping the bridge between a risk in this source list and a concrete test an engineer can run. Where ISO
42001 or NIST AI RMF establish that a control must exist, AISVS states the condition that demonstrates it does. The two
are complements, not substitutes, and reading them together turns a control objective into an audit step.

AISVS also assigns each requirement a level from 1 to 3 reflecting implementation difficulty and how situational the
control is. That maps cleanly onto the tier model used throughout this crosswalk, so the tier column below carries real
information about sequencing rather than a subjective judgement.

### LLM01 - Prompt Injection

AISVS treats prompt injection as an input validation problem with a dedicated chapter. C2.1 carries eight requirements
covering normalization, encoding smuggling, classifier screening, instruction hierarchy and special-token handling, and
C10.4 extends the same screening to MCP tool responses as an indirect injection path. The 2026 entry adds cross-modal
attacks, which C2.2 covers for image, audio and video inputs.

### LLM02 - Sensitive Information Disclosure

AISVS splits disclosure across the retrieval boundary and the response boundary. C5.2 requires the end-user
authorization context to be enforced at retrieval rather than the service account, and C7.3 plus C11.2 stop what does
get generated from carrying data the requester may not receive.

Training data restricted to features required for the stated purpose, reducing what can be disclosed at all |

### LLM03 - Excessive Agency

AISVS bounds agency with runtime enforcement rather than prompt instructions. C9.2 gates high-impact and irreversible
actions behind verified human approval, C9.5.3 requires access control decisions to be made by a policy engine and never
by the model, and C9.1 caps budgets.

### LLM04 - Supply Chain

AISVS treats the model artifact as the supply chain unit. C6 requires approved sources, malware scanning, integrity
verification and a signed AI BOM, and C4.1.2 closes the deserialization path that turns a downloaded artifact into code
execution. The 2026 entry adds artifact provenance, which C3.1 covers through signing, load-time verification and an
origin inventory.

### LLM05 - Data and Model Poisoning

AISVS puts poisoning defense in the training data chapter. C1.3 requires poisoning detection in training and fine-tuning
pipelines including the clean-label case, and C1.1 plus C12.5 give the integrity monitoring and lineage needed to
attribute a poisoned corpus after the fact. The 2026 entry adds fine-tuning subversion, covered by approved-source
adapters (C6.1.2) and integrity-verified fine-tuning inputs (C3.5).

### LLM06 - Unbounded Consumption

AISVS bounds consumption at the runtime rather than the gateway. C9.1 requires per-tool quotas and per-execution budgets
covering recursion depth, tokens and monetary spend, and C11.2.2 requires rate limits sized to the threat model rather
than a generic API throttle.

### LLM07 - Misinformation

AISVS attacks misinformation through provenance and confidence. C7.4 requires RAG attribution derived from retrieval
metadata rather than generated by the model, and C7.2 plus C12.3 require confidence estimation, fallback behaviour and
hallucination rate tracking over time.

### LLM08 - Hidden Context Exposure

AISVS handles prompt leakage as an output filtering and secret hygiene problem. C7.3.2 blocks responses disclosing
system prompt or backend content, and C9.5.4 keeps credentials out of the observable context so a leaked prompt is not
also a leaked secret. The 2026 entry widens System Prompt Leakage to any hidden context, including retrieved policy text
and tool schemas; C10.2.4 limits which tool schemas reach a caller at all. AISVS treats hidden context as discoverable,
matching the 2026 principle that it is never a security boundary.

### LLM10 - Improper Output Handling

AISVS treats model output as untrusted input to whatever consumes it. C7.1 requires schema validation and rejection of
non-conforming output, and C7.3.3 blocks the outbound request path that turns rendered output into exfiltration. The
2026 entry widens output handling to insecure generated code. AISVS has no requirement that scans generated code itself;
C9.3.7 covers the dependency path, and code review and SAST remain outside the standard.

Generated code (2026 scope): packages and external resources named in model output verified against an allow-list before they are installed or invoked |

#### Three-tier mitigations

**Tier 1 - Immediate (pre-production gate):**

- 7.1.1: Verify that the application validates all model outputs against a defined schema and rejects any output that
  does not match.
- 7.1.2: Verify that model-generated output is bounded by length limits and termination controls.
- 9.3.2: Verify that tool outputs are validated against schemas.

**Tier 2 - Short-term (first 30 days):**

- 7.3.3: Verify that model-generated output is prevented from triggering outbound requests.
- 9.3.6: Verify that there is architectural separation between processing of untrusted tool outputs and agent
  operations.
- 9.3.7: Verify that external resources named in model output are verified against an approved allow-list or registry
  before the agent installs or invokes them.

**Tier 3 - Strategic:**

- 7.3.4: Verify that model outputs are checked for hidden, encoded, or misleading content created through homoglyphs,
  formatting, metadata, or structured fields.
