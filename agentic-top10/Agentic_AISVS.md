# Agentic Top 10 2026 × OWASP AISVS 1.0

Mapping the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications
2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/) to the [OWASP Artificial
Intelligence Security Verification Standard
1.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-artificial-intelligence-security-verification-standard-aisvs-docs/), a technical
verification standard of 191 testable requirements across 12 chapters, used by engineers and auditors to verify that a
specific AI system implements a control rather than merely documents it.

---

## Why AISVS for this source list

Most frameworks already in this crosswalk answer the question of what an organisation should govern. AISVS answers a
different question: given a running AI system, what does an assessor check, and what does a pass look like. Every
requirement is written to be independently verifiable and starts with the words Verify that.

That makes this mapping the bridge between a risk in this source list and a concrete test an engineer can run. Where ISO
42001 or NIST AI RMF establish that a control must exist, AISVS states the condition that demonstrates it does. The two
are complements, not substitutes, and reading them together turns a control objective into an audit step.

AISVS also assigns each requirement a level from 1 to 3 reflecting implementation difficulty and how situational the
control is. That maps cleanly onto the tier model used throughout this crosswalk, so the tier column below carries real
information about sequencing rather than a subjective judgement.

### ASI01 - Agent Goal Hijack

AISVS addresses goal hijack at both the injection point and the persistence point. C2.1 screens the steering input,
C10.4.2 screens tool responses, and C8.2.3 stops unvalidated agent and tool output being written into trusted memory
where a hijack would survive the session.

### ASI02 - Tool Misuse and Exploitation

AISVS constrains tools declaratively and enforces the declaration. C9.3 requires tool manifests declaring privileges,
resource limits and output validation, and requires the runtime to enforce them; C9.5.1 adds parameter-value level
authorization so a legitimate tool cannot be called destructively.

### ASI03 - Identity and Privilege Abuse

AISVS makes the agent a first-class principal rather than a credential holder. C9.4.1 requires a unique cryptographic
identity per agent instance, C9.5.2 requires a scope-limited user context token enforced at every downstream call, and
C10.2 adds OAuth 2.1 token validation on the MCP path.

### ASI04 - Agentic Supply Chain

AISVS covers the runtime-fetched supply chain that static inventory misses. C10.1 requires trusted sources and
allow-listed MCP servers, C9.3.7 requires allow-list verification of resources named in model output, and C10.4.8
requires re-approval when a tool definition changes.

### ASI05 - Unexpected Code Execution

AISVS treats generated code as untrusted output requiring a sandbox. C9.3.1 and C4.1.1 require isolated execution,
C4.1.2 blocks code execution during artifact deserialization, and C9.1.1 caps the blast radius of anything that does
execute.

### ASI07 - Insecure Inter-Agent Communications

AISVS covers inter-agent communication mainly through the MCP transport chapter. C10.3 requires authenticated encrypted

### ASI08 - Cascading Agent Failures

AISVS treats cascade as a containment problem. C9.1.3 requires a swarm-level kill-switch able to halt all active agent
instances, C9.6.3 requires the kill-switch channel to be out-of-band from the agent runtime, and C9.2.10 requires
chain-wide approval gates to take the highest-impact classification present.

#### Three-tier mitigations

**Tier 1 - Immediate (pre-production gate):**

- 12.1.1: Verify that AI interactions are logged with session context and AI-specific telemetry.
- 9.6.1: Verify that a manual kill-switch mechanism exists to immediately halt AI model inference and outputs.

**Tier 2 - Short-term (first 30 days):**

- 12.2.2: Verify that behavioral anomaly detection identifies unusual conversation patterns, excessive retry attempts,
  or probing behaviors.
- 9.4.2: Verify that agent-initiated actions are cryptographically bound to each step of the execution chain for
  non-repudiation.
- 9.2.5: Verify that any self-modification capability (e.g., prompt rewriting, tool-list changes, parameter updates) is
  restricted by enforceable boundaries.
- 12.4.1: Verify that autonomous action triggers include proactive behavior-pattern analysis, security evaluation, and
  threat-landscape assessment.
- 12.4.3: Verify that kill-switch activations and override commands are logged.
- 12.5.3: Verify that all model changes generate immutable audit records.

**Tier 3 - Strategic:**

- 12.2.6: Verify that LLM API traffic is monitored for covert-channel indicators and communication signatures to
  identify malware and command-and-control (C2) activity.
